            Well, in this age of social media, I think the genuine expression of opinions and views is lost. Everyone is so occupied with posting their breakfast <br />
            and their runs and their work and what not. I hate that so I refrain myself from such idiocy and have established my own little real estate on the internet <br />
            where I ramble on about what I want to express. And this will also help me sharpen my development skills which I hope to make a career out of. <br />
            <br />Now mind you, I did have a website previously where I posted poems and short stories but that had to be shutdown due to my lack of effort and costs of <br /> 
            the VPS. Now I've gone to the path of free hosting with Firebase. See how that goes. <br /> 
            <br /> Enough of that. Now, regarding the content of this website, I've envisioned it to be a sort of a journal for myself - a place to express my opionions <br />
            and views, as well as post some of my creative works - if I ever get back to that. <br /> 
            <br /> Hope you enjoy reading my ramblings and have a good day!
